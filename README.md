# Introduction

A Simple ToDo App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so folx can sign up, customize & personalize the app

# Objectives

- It's a beginner level app created to understand how MVC concept and logins are added

---

# Who is this for?

- It's for beginners & intermediates with little more experience, to help understand the various aspects of building a node app with some complex features

---

# Packages/Dependencies used

bcrypt, connect-mongo, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, passport, passport-local, validator

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `key: value`
  - PORT: 2121 (can be any port example: 3000)
